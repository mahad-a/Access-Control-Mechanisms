# User Authentication and Access Control Mechanisms

## Guide to Running the Application
All libraries used for the implementation of this application prototype are pre-installed in the VM. No need for a requirements.txt, however you may need to run the following commands (only if [Step 2](#step-2-run-the-code) fails):

Check for Python and `pip` installed in your system:
```bash
python --version
pip --version
```
Run the following command (as all other used libraries are part of Python's standard library):
```bash
pip install bcrypt
```

### Step 1: Locate the Main Program
The main program file is located in the `src` folder. Navigate to the `src` directory:
```bash
cd src
```

### Step 2: Run the Code
To run the program, execute the `main.py` script:
```bash
python main.py
```
Ensure you're using the Python version that matches the environment, which should be pre-configured on the VM.

### Step 3: Interacting with the Program
Once the program is running, you can interact with it as specified in the assignment manual. If the program involves user input (such as a login or menu system), follow the on-screen prompts.

## Additional Details
The exact solution to each problem from assignment manual can be found within the python script labeled as such, for example `Problem2.py` correlates with Problem 2 in the assignment. Select parts of implementation for each question could be found in other question parts, please refer to the provided comment to locate where the solution can be found.
